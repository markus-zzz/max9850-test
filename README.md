# A simple test-bench for my ULX3S MAX9850 expansion board (not a PMOD)

Blinking a LED test using SW driven I2C to write to a control register inside
the MAX9850 that controls a GPIO pin that is routed back to the FPGA driving
the LED.

The purpose of this basic test is simply to verify that the electrical
connections are reasonably sound and that the part survived the assembly
process.
